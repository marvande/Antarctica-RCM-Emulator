<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Antarctic ice sheet contains the majority of ice on Earth and would be the most significant
contributor to sea-level rise if it were to melt completely. A critical variable in studying the
stability and evolution of ice on Antarctica, such as glaciers and ice shelves, is surface mass
balance (SMB). SMB is the balance between processes that add and remove ice on top of an ice
sheet, glacier, or ice shelf. For example, those processes can include snowfall, surface melt, or
erosion by winds. To predict changes in the Antarctic ice sheet, climate scientists need highly
detailed information about SMB.

High-resolution maps of SMB are usually only produced by regional climate models (RCM).
But these are costly and time-consuming to create because they require calculations on very
powerful computers. The goal of this project was to accomplish this faster and with similar
accuracy by using machine learning to predict SMB changes.

We trained a machine-learning algorithm i.e., a computer program that recognizes patterns in
data, to learn the relationship between a group of low-resolution images of climate variables
and a high-resolution image of regional SMB. The low-resolution data consisted of a bundle
of atmospheric variables influencing SMB, such as precipitation, temperature, and surface
pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, an interesting region of Antarctica. Those coarse-grain
atmospheric variables are easier and cheaper to obtain from worldwide simulations made by
climate scientists.

Our machine-learning model can recreate regional images of SMB almost identical to ground
truth observations by learning the relationship between low and high-resolution inputs. The
model only struggles to predict proper SMB values for very dry areas (where the SMB is small)
because it tends to emphasize points with larger changes in SMB. The predictive model is very
fast, with training under ten minutes and output in a few seconds. What remains to be studied is
whether the model would need new training for every new (unseen) region in Antarctica or if it
could be deployed across areas.

We conclude that it is possible to make fast and detailed reproductions of SMB at regional scales
using machine learning. Therefore, machine learning can be an interesting and cheap tool for
gathering local-scale information about how ice sheets vary with climate change.
